[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Builds Schedule)
The __Builds Schedule__ page in the administration area of a specific project displays [schedule triggers](configuring-schedule-triggers.md) configured for [build configurations](build-configuration.md) belonging to this project. __Builds Schedule__ for the [Root Project](project.md#Root+Project) displays the list of triggers for the entire TeamCity server.

You can conveniently view the available schedule and plan your builds optimizing allocation of dependent hardware/software resources.

From this page it is also possible to [edit](configuring-build-triggers.md), disable or delete the triggers.

The Build Schedule page also displays the information for [paused build configurations](build-configuration.md#Build+Configuration+State).
