To back up build agent's data: 

	
2. __Build Agent configuration__   
Back up the `<`[`Agent Home Directory`](agent-home-directory.md)`>/conf/buildAgent.properties` file.   
You may also wish to back up any other configuration files changed (Build Agent configuration is specified in `<`[`Agent Home Directory`](agent-home-directory.md)`>/conf` and `<`[`Agent Home Directory`](agent-home-directory.md)`>/launcher/conf` directories).
	
4. __Log files__   
If you need Build Agent log files (mainly used for problem solving or debug purposes), back up the `<`[`Agent Home Directory`](agent-home-directory.md)`>/logs` directory.

<note>

You may also wish to back up Build Agent Windows Service settings, if they were modified.
