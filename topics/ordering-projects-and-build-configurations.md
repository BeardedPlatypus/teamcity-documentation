[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Ordering Projects and Build Configurations)
By default, TeamCity displays projects, their subprojects, build configurations, and templates in the alphabetical order.   
Project administrators can apply custom ordering to subprojects and build configurations on the __Project Settings__ page for the parent project and use it as the default order.

__To enable reordering__, use the corresponding button above the list.

Individual users can still manually tweak the display using the up\-down button in the [Configure Visible Projects](managing-projects-and-build-configurations.md#Configuring+Visibility) pop-up window on the __Projects Overview__ page.
