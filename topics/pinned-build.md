[//]: # (auxiliary-id: Pinned Build)

A build can be "pinned" to prevent it from being removed when a clean\-up procedure is executed, as stipulated by the [clean-up policy](clean-up.md).

There are several ways to pin/unpin a build :
* using the [Build Results page](working-with-build-results.md),  the __Build Action__ drop\-down menu
* on the Overview tab of the Build Configuration Home Page using the pin icon
The Pin/Unpin build dialog also allows you to tag the build.

If the build has snapshot dependencies, the __Apply to all snapshot dependencies__ box appears. Checking the box will apply the actions (pinning/unpinning, adding / removing tags) to all dependency builds of the current one.
